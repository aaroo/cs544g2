		-need to get the url of the Git \cmd directory your computer. Git is located here:
			C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_<guid>\cmd\git.exe
			On your computer, replace <user> with your user and find out what the <guid> is for your computer. (The guid may change each time GitHub updates PortableGit, but they're working on a solution to that.)
	Copy it and paste it into a command prompt (right-click > paste to paste in the terminal) to verify that it works. You should see the Git help response that lists common Git commands. 
	If you see The system cannot find the path specified. Then the URL isnâ€™t right. Once you have it right, create the link to the directory using this format: C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\GitHub\PortableGit_<guid>\cmd
	(Note: \cmd at the end, not \cmd\git.exe anymore!)
