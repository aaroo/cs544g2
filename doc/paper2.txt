Message Definition:

[client opens TCP/UDP connection to server]
Client: Hello, I am [name], key: [key] -> state: authenticating
Server: accept -> state: accepting status submission / reject -> state: connection closes
Client: sending status/information
Server: echo accept/reject -> state: accepting

So let’s assume the server can also control the clients in a very basic way – start/stop monitoring and change parameters.

Extensibility:

Security:
	Authentication:
	Encryption:
	In order to make it secure, the clients need to know server’s public key and vice versa. Therefore, we can reduce the need for configuration to just this one thing and implement a simple auto-discovery (kind of like DHCP).
 
The clients can find the server (and server(s) can find all clients) by sending properly signed broadcast messages. Clients/servers will respond only to the messages that are signed with a trusted key and the response may(/must?) be unicast to limit redundant traffic / discovery by other parties.
