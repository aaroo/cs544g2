Service Description 

The Monitor and Control Garage Protocol (MCGP) provides a mechanism for users to manage, monitor and control a garage through the services defined by the protocol. MCGP provides a communication specification for applications, and is a protocol defined at the application layer utilizing TCP/IP. MCGP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol in order to have a reliable, secure and ordered connection. It adopts client-server mode and provide safety mechanism, the mechanism is based by user authentication which is realized by message signing via public-private key and embedding hash-signature in PDU. 
After the client passes the server’s authentication, users can have a remote connection with their garage. Applications that follows MCGP will provide two kinds of services for users. First is the monitor service, server may connect to many digital devices in the garage such as thermometer, barometer and hygrometer. This allows a user to watch various environment parameters through the client. Second is the control service, in which a user can remotely control the door of the garage or the light inside it through client. Figure 1 is the schematic diagram of the MCGP.
