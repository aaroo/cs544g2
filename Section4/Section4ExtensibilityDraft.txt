MCGP is build to be an extensible application level protocol. The first reason is that it is meant to run on top of existing protocols like TCP. Since TCP itself is built to be extensible, we inherit that benefit. We can add a layer of security using TLS. We could use it with Websocket(WS) or Secure Web Socket (WSS). We could make further security enhancements by adding secure tokens like OAuth in the payload.


In addition to extensibility with sublayers, there is also the ability to extend on an application layer. We could implement a version to be more specific that would be built on top of MCGP. It could validate certain types of devices by massages in the payload. 


We could also build on top to add additional device types with new device codes to the pdu in future versions. 


Additional protocols also extend this one and define custom messages and build a more specific message spec that certain devices and server applications could honor, for instance say Company X builds garage doors and other automated devices, they could define a protocol XMCGP which has specific messages that X devices and X Server implementation understand. This MCGP serves as a building block for future home automation product protocols
